# ARIOT
AUGMENTED REALITY RENDERED FOR  IOT APPLICATIONS

This folder consists of 3 branches - RaspberryPi, Unity and Arduino(ESP8266)

All the respective branches consists of code based on their own platform.(refer readme in individual branches to know on how to configure and use the code as they are hardware and platform dependent)

RaspberryPi mostly has all codes build on "python - 2.7"

Unity has a lot of configurations and visual developments to make on its software and the code is mostly written in "C#"

Arduino(ESP) has codes to be burnt on ESP8266(nodemcu) and is written in C language.
